## Overview

Sagui is a cross-platform C library which helps to develop web servers or
frameworks. Its core has been developed using the [GNU libmicrohttpd][4],
[uthash][5], [PCRE2][6], [ZLib][7] and [GnuTLS][8], that's why it is so fast,
compact and useful to run on embedded systems.

## Features

- **Requests processing through:**
  - Event-driven - single-thread + polling.
  - Threaded - one thread per request.
  - Polling - pre-allocated threads.
  - Isolated request - request processed outside main thread.
- **High-performance path routing that supports:**
  - Regular expressions using [PCRE2][9] [syntax][10].
  - Just-in-time optimization ([JIT][11]).
  - Binary search in path entry-points.
- **HTTP compression:**
  - [Deflate][12] for static contents and
    streams compression.
  - [Gzip][13] for files compression.
- **HTTPS support:**
  - TLS 1.3 through [GnuTLS][8] library.
- **Dual stack:**
  - Single socket for IPv4 and IPv6 support.
- **Basic authentication:**
  - For standard login using _user name/password_.
- **Upload/download streaming by:**
  - Payload - for raw data transferring as JSON, XML and other.
  - File - for large data transferring as videos, images, binaries and so on.
- **Mathematical expression evaluator:**
  - Arithmetic, bitwise and logical operators.
  - Variables allocation at build and/or run time.
  - Macro support to define functions at run time.
  - Extendable with custom functions.
  - Error handling with error kind and position.
- **Dynamic strings:**
  - Makes it easy strings operations in C.
- **String map:**
  - Fast key-value mapping.
- **And more:**
  - Fields, parameters, cookies, headers under hash table structure.
  - Several callbacks for total library customization.

## Examples

A minimal `hello world` HTTP server:

```c
void req_cb(void *cls, struct sg_httpreq *req, struct sg_httpres *res) {
    sg_httpres_send(res, "Hello world", "text/plain", 200);
}

int main(void) {
    struct sg_httpsrv *srv = sg_httpsrv_new(req_cb, NULL);
    sg_httpsrv_listen(srv, 8080, false);
    printf("Server running at http://localhost:%d\n", sg_httpsrv_port(srv));
    getchar();
    sg_httpsrv_free(srv);
    return 0;
}
```

The router support is isolated from the HTTP feature, so it can be used to route
any path structure, for example:

```c
void home_cb(void *cls, struct sg_route *route) {
    printf("Home\n");
}

void download_cb(void *cls, struct sg_route *route) {
    printf("Download\n");
}

int main(void) {
    struct sg_router *router;
    struct sg_route *routes = NULL;
    sg_routes_add(&routes, "/home", home_cb, NULL);
    sg_routes_add(&routes, "/download", download_cb, NULL);
    router = sg_router_new(routes);
    sg_router_dispatch(router, "/home", NULL);
    sg_routes_cleanup(&routes);
    sg_router_free(router);
    return 0;
}
```

lastly, putting everything together:

```c
struct Holder {
    struct sg_httpreq *req;
    struct sg_httpres *res;
};

void route_home_cb(void *cls, struct sg_route *route) {
    struct Holder *holder = sg_route_user_data(route);
    sg_httpres_send(holder->res, "Home", "text/plain", 200);
}

void route_download_cb(void *cls, struct sg_route *route) {
    struct Holder *holder = sg_route_user_data(route);
    sg_httpres_send(holder->res, "Download", "text/plain", 200);
}

void req_cb(void *cls, struct sg_httpreq *req, struct sg_httpres *res) {
    struct sg_router *router = cls;
    struct Holder holder = {req, res};
    if (sg_router_dispatch(router, sg_httpreq_path(req), &holder) != 0)
        sg_httpres_send(res, "404", "text/plain", 404);
}

int main(void) {
    struct sg_route *routes = NULL;
    struct sg_router *router;
    struct sg_httpsrv *srv;
    sg_routes_add(&routes, "/home", route_home_cb, NULL);
    sg_routes_add(&routes, "/download", route_download_cb, NULL);
    router = sg_router_new(routes);
    srv = sg_httpsrv_new(req_cb, router);
    sg_httpsrv_listen(srv, 8080, false);
    printf("Server running at http://localhost:%d\n", sg_httpsrv_port(srv));
    getchar();
    sg_httpsrv_free(srv);
    sg_routes_cleanup(&routes);
    sg_router_free(router);
    return 0;
}
```

There are other examples available in the [`examples`](examples) directory.

## Downloading

All stable binaries are available for download at the [releases page][2] with
their respective checksums. For other systems, the packages
`Source code (tar.gz|zip)` contains the library source.

## Building/installing

The easiest way to build the library is using a Docker container as a builder.
Follow the instructions at [libsagui-docker/README.md][17] for more details.

Check the [docs/BUILD.md](docs/BUILD.md) for more instructions for how to build
the examples, tests, documentation and the library. Also, take a look at
[docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) for how to install the library from sources
on your system.

## Documentation

The documentation has been written in [Doxygen][15] and is available in HTML
format at [libsagui-docs/index.html][16].

## Versioning

Starting from the version 1.0.0, Sagui follows the [SemVer][14] rules regarding
API changes with backwards compatibility and stable ABI across major releases.

## Compatibility

A typical upgrade of the Sagui library does not break the ABI at all. Take a
look at the [API/ABI compatibility report][18] to compare most recent library
versions.

See also [Checking backward API/ABI compatibility of Sagui library versions](docs/ABIComplianceChecker.md).

## Contributing

Sagui is totally open source and would not be possible without our
[contributors](THANKS). If you want to submit contributions, please fork the
project on GitHub and send a pull request. You retain the copyright on your
